# PiDashboard
A simple dashboard I've created to display on my raspberry when it's not in use

1. Install apache on your raspberry
2. Copy index.html over the default one from apache in `/var/www/html/index.html`
3. Edit index.html and set location for time and weather (there are comments set in place to help you)
